# The PneumaShoe - An Intermittent Pneumatic Compression Device

	This year, our senior design team is building the PneumaShoe, an intermittent pneumatic compression device (IPCD) meant to prevent Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). VTE is a leading preventable cause of death in hospitals with nearly 10 million cases each year. At its core, our device is meant to be driven by an Arduino or other microcontroller. During our time in Malawi, we began working with an Arduino for our device, but we didn’t get past making very rudimentary code. Currently, our device can’t interact with patients or physicians. Furthermore, the duty cycle hasn’t been optimized, and the code we wrote was meant to demonstrate some of our device’s functionality as opposed to fully automating the device. For our final project, we would like to program an Arduino for our senior design project. Our goal for the project is to create a program that is adaptive if an edge-case should occur and interactive when end-user input is applied.
